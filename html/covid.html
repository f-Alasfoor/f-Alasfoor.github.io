<h2>-- The current situation --</h2>
<p>Covid-19 has undoubtedly had a major impact on the ways universities around the world have been teaching students and relaying information to them, and the situation is no different here. To mitigate the damage dealt and avoid the risks as much as possible, lectures had to be split to be online and on-campus, each having certain days allotted for them in the week. The following table showcases how the week has been split up into online and on-campus days:</p>

<h2>-- How are online lectures handled? --</h2>
<p>Online lectures have become part of the norm as of now, and thankfully they are being handled in a way that preserves the atmosphere of an on-campus lecture. The lecturers relay the relevant information, give tasks, and ask questions while students can answer and talk by using either the chat-box or their microphone. While it may not be the most ideal situation, the fact that this is possible at all proves how far technology has come, which is another reason as to why software engineering is such a unique course.</p>
