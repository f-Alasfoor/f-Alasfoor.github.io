<h2>-- Why I chose it --</h2>
<p>Ever since I learned what a computer was, I was always fascinated in how they functioned. As the years went on, I started to gain a basic understanding of how programs worked, the code involved, the work required, and so on. I decided that I wanted to explore this aspect of computers further, and so I dedicated my studies to the field of software engineering to be able to gain a deeper understanding on the aforementioned aspects as well as be able to code my own programs later down the line.</p>
